# Password Manager
A password manager with a GUI, created in Java.

"Detailed" description of the project
----
It is essentially a "database accessor" with a fancy GUI. The passwords are encrypted (full file encryption when exiting the application), and a master password is required to access the application/database (as a "security measure").<br/>
<b>REMEMBER:</b> This is just an experimental "project" from a 16-year-old. I do not guarantee any security of the passwords stored in this application.
